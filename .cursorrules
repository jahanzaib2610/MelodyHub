Purpose: canonical, opinionated conventions for structuring and building the Next.js + NextAuth + Prisma project. Use this file as the single source of truth for on‑boarding, code reviews, and new feature scaffolding.

1. High-level principles

Readability first — code is written for humans. Prefer clarity over cleverness.

Single responsibility — files and components do one thing and do it well.

Reusability by composition — small, focused components composed to form larger UIs.

Type-safety — prefer TypeScript across the codebase.

API contracts — keep backend API routes stable and versioned when necessary.

Secure-by-default — validate inputs, sanitize outputs, and never hardcode secrets.
